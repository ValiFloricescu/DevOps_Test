-`♡´- Greeting -`♡´-,

This is my solution for the test I had to do. I hope it's satisfying!
I founded to be pretty challenging working with docker sometimes, at less untill I could understand exactly how it works.
The small trap in problem 3 company.sql was very nice and fun to find and solve.
I feel that some specification could be more exacted, for example the path to where we should put the local files in the container, so we could emulate better the proffesional enviroment, because in a real situation would be pretty unpleasent to look for a fill that a coworker put somewhere else.

Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy this test!

Best regards,
        Bogdan-Valentin Floricescu -`♡´-
